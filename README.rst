======

This package provides helpers for session/transaction management, dependency
injection, and lazy loading.

Installation
------------

Install using setuptools::

    $ python setup.py install

Compatibility
-------------

The test suite has been run on the following platforms without failures:

* Python 2.5.5, Debian 6.0.3 (squeeze) i686
* Python 2.6.6, Debian 6.0.3 (squeeze) i686
* Python 2.7.2, Ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric) x86_64
* Python 3.2.2, Ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric) x86_64

Note that test coverage is not 100% (statement coverage is about 80%), so there
may still be issues, especially with Python versions 2.5 or >3. Please report
any such issues if you find them, preferably with a corresponding test.
