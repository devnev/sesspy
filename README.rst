This package provides helpers for session/transaction management, dependency

Installation
------------

Install using setuptools::

Compatibility
-------------

The test suite has been run on the following platforms without failures:

* Python 2.5.5, Debian 6.0.3 (squeeze) i686

may still be issues, especially with Python versions 2.5 or >3. Please report
any such issues if you find them, preferably with a corresponding test.
